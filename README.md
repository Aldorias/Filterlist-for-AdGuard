# Filterlist for AdGuard 1.0

![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/Filterlist-for-AdGuard/master/Screenshots/Logo_AG.png)

A filterlist that consolidates 56 lists for use in AdGuard Home (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardHome).

* Blocks many ads, affiliates, analytics, enrichments, widgets and trackers
* Blocks crypto-locker, drug, fake, fake news, phishing, ransomware, scam, spam, suspicious, and typosquatting websites
* The final blocklist is sorted, duplicates have been removed and some cleanup has been done
* Includes the official **AdGuardSDNSFilter**

_Please Note: The list is aggressive so please ensure that you add your own "Custom filtering rules" for domains you want to allow.
e.g: @@||nexusmods.com^$important_

## Usage

Once you have AdGuard Home ready and are logged in, use its main menu to add one blocklist and one allowlist.
